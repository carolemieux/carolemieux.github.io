          <div class="hbar"></div>

          <section class="inner">
            <p>Software bugs remain pervasive in modern software systems. As software becomes increasingly intertwined
              in all aspects of our lives, the consequences of these bugs become increasingly severe. For instance,
              since the mid 2010s, several important security vulnerabilities have emerged from basic correctness bugs
              in software (e.g. <a href="https://heartbleed.com/">Heartbleed</a>, <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudbleed">Cloudbleed</a>, <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellshock_(software_bug)">Shellshock</a> ). Though not all bugs
              cause important security vulnerabilities, their overall cost remains high: one estimate puts the cost of
              dealing with software failures and defects <i>in the United States alone</i> in 2018 at nearly
              USD$1,540,000,000---the worldwide impact of these defects is even more severe.
            </p>

            <p>
              While human-written tests are a prevailing method for assuring the quality of software in practice, they
              are still subject to human error, and allowing bugs to slip through the cracks that the human tester did
              not consider. This class will explore topics in the field of <i>automated testing</i>, which aims, at a
              high-level, to reduce the developer burden in discovering bugs and writing test cases. Recent advances in
              this field leverage static and dynamic information from the program under test in order to effectively
              explore the space of behaviors of the program under test, enabling the quick discovery of <a
                href="https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160926.txt">potentially severe security bugs</a>.
            </p>

            <p>The concerns of scalable bug detection and program debugging require innovation from multiple different
              fronts.
              As such, this course will cover papers from Software Engineering, Programming Languages, Security, and
              Systems venues.</p>


            <h4>Course-level learning goals</h4>

            The course will provide an opportunity for participants to:
            <ul>
              <li>Become familiar with key techniques used in automated testing tools (including concolic execution,
                coverage-guided fuzz testing, search-based algorithms);</li>
              <li>Critically evaluate research papers in the field of program testing and analysis;</li>
              <li>Program automated testing tools in Python;</li>
              <li>Design and conduct experimental evaluation of a program testing or analysis tool.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This is a seminar-style class, which is primarily driven by in-class discussion of a research paper. Each
              student is expected to submit a <a href="#responses">response</a> to the paper being discussed in the class
              18 hours ahead of the class in which it is discussed. Each student will also serve as discussion lead for 1
              paper; the discussion lead will read through other students' responses and
              prepare questions to start the discussion.</p>

            <p>In addition to readings, there will be a <a href="#assign">programming assignment</a>, which will give you the
              opportunity to implement and evaluate some of the test generation algorithms we will explore in papers.
            </p>

            <p>
              The bulk of your course mark will come from an <a href="#project">open-ended course project</a>. The project can be conducted as
              part of a team.  The project deliverables include an initial proposal, an in-class presentation of the work, and a
              final report summarizing what has been achieved.

          <section class="inner">
            <p>
              Read each paper to the best of your ability before drafting your paper response. There are two goals to the paper responses:
              <ul>
                <li> Convey your understanding of the paper's core innovations
                </li>
                <li>
                  Convey your opinion of the paper, in order to spark in-class discussion
                </li>
              </ul>
              Structure your paper responses as:
              <ul>
              <li>
                A short paragraph summarizing the paper. What is the problem being tackled? How was it adressed by prior work? What are the innovation(s) proposed in this paper? How are those innovations evaluated?
              </li>
              <li>
                Your opinion of the paper, which can be structured in a paragraph or bullet points. Some questions to guide you as you read and write your response:
                <ul>
                  <li> 
                    What remains unclear after reading the paper? Are there any clarification questions whose answers would substantially change your opinion of the paper?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    How does the paper's evaluation match with the proposed problem statement?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Do you forsee any barriers to the applicability of the technique proposed in the paper? If so, how could these barriers be overcome?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Which technical innovations are most compelling to you?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Which problems remain unsolved after this paper?
                  </li>
              </ul>
              </li>
              </ul>
              Remember, the responses help spark in-class discussion. Thus, specificity and depth in your responses is useful. 
              A detailed description of a particular issue raised while reading the paper will be more useful than several high-level comments. 
              For example, if you have doubts about the scalability of a particular technique, detail specific examples that raise those doubts, 
              rather than simply saying  "I think the technique will not scale".
              </p>


            <p>
            Paper responses must be submitted to the course Piazza <b>18 hours</b> before the class on which they are do. 
            Thus, for Monday readings, your paper response should be submitted before 2:30pm on Sunday. For Wednesday readings,
            they should be submitted before 2:30pm on Tuesday.
            </p>

            <p>
            Your paper responses will be submitted as follow-up discussions to each paper's post on the <a href="
            piazza.com/ubc.ca/winterterm12022/cpsc539l">course Piazza</a>. 
            You should not read other students' response before writing your own. After posting your response, you may engage with other students' reponses, e.g. answering a clarification question someone else had.

            The course project constitutes the majority of the course grade. The project is open-ended; the purpose of the project
            is to give you the opportunity to conduct research in the field of program analysis, debugging, or automated testing.
            You may pursue the project alone, though I recommend you do it in groups of 2-4; this will give you the opportunity 
            to conduct a project with broader impact.
          </p>
          
          <p>
          The scope of acceptable project topics is broad. You are encouraged to find a project with intersects with your 
          own research interests or topic of specialization. But, your project should touch topics in debugging, program analysis, and
          testing. You may consider a project where you: develop a new tool for testing/analyzing programs in a particular domain,
          tweak an existing algorithm, conduct an extensive re-evaluation of an existing tool,  reimplement an
          algorithm in a new domain, or create a benchmark suite.  
          If you are not sure if a project is in scope, feel free to set up a meeting with me prior to submitting the project proposal.
        </p>

        <p>(Sep 2nd Update): I will post some project ideas here soon.</p>
        
        <h3>Deliverables</h3>
          <p>
            <b>Proposal.</b>
            Your project proposal should roughly follow this structure, adapting to the nature of your project (new tool vs. replication vs. benchmark creation):
            <ul>
              <li> <b>Background. </b> What is the problem domain you are investigating? Why is the problem important?
              </li>
              <li> <b>Intended approach. </b> What, precisely, are you aiming to build or investigate in the project? What precise problem will you be solving?
              </li>
              <li> <b>Evaluation plan. </b>  If you are planning on running an experiment, how many benchmarks will you evaluate on? How long will you run your tool(s)? 
              </li>
              <!-- <li> <b>Division of tasks. </b> If you are working in a group, what is your  plan to divide work on the project?
              </li> -->
              <li> <b> Timeline. </b> Determine a timeline you will follow to achieve your implementation and experimental goals, as well as to deliver the writeup + presentation.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Check-in.</b>
              The check-in is nearly a month in to the project. It should outline the progress achieved so far. If the timeline's goals have 
              not been reached so far, provide an updated timeline.  If, in starting the project, a different research direction has emerged
              as the more interesting one to follow, the check-in provides a mechanism to update the proposal.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Presentation.</b> The final presentation should concisely convey:
            <ul>
            <li> <b>Background + Problem Context </b> Why is this project important?
            </li>
            <li> <b>Key details of accomplished approach. </b> In what you ended up building, what are the key contributions?
            </li>
            <li> <b>Evaluation Results. </b> How did you evaluate your approach? What were the results?
            </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Writeup.</b> Your final writeup should cover the following topics. It should be in a format common to and PL/SE conference. 
            <ul>
              <li> <b>Background. </b> What is the problem domain you are investigating? Why is the problem important?
              </li>
              <li> <b>Approach. </b> What, precisely, did you build or investigate in the project?
              </li>
              <li> <b>Evaluation. </b> What research questions will your evaluation answer? How does your experiment design help answer these questions? What are the results of the experiment, and how do those results inform the research questions?
              </li>
              <li> <b> Discussion. </b> Discuss: any observations on the experiment which do not fit in the main evaluation, any goals that were not achieved, potential room for improvement
              </li>
              <li> <b>Related work. </b> How does your approach compare and contrast with related approaches?
              </li>
              <!-- <li> <b>Division of tasks. </b> If you are working in a group, how did you divide work on the project? Include who wrote different sections of the writeup, made different elements of the presentation.
              </li> -->
