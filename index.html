Software has become intertwined with so many parts of our lives. We hope it is correct and secure, but in practice, it is often not. The goal of my research is to build tooling that helps developers improve the correctness of software by exposing software behaviours as they exist in-the-wild. This leads to a broad array of research interests over software engineering and programming languages topics: test-input generation, unit test generation, code-documentation inconsistency detection, specification mining, type inference, amongst others. 

</p>
 


<p>In May 2021, I received my Ph.D. at the University of California, Berkeley, where I was advised by <a href="http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ksen">Koushik Sen</a>. My PhD research focused on <b>automatic test-input generation</b>, particularly <b>fuzz testing</b>, with the goal of producing inputs that induce correctness, security, and performance bugs in software. I also explored how the search techniques used to scale these input generation tools  apply in the domain of <b>program synthesis</b>. My dissertation is available on the <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2021/EECS-2021-43.html">EECS department website</a>.  
</p>

<p>
From July 2021-2022, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Microsoft Research, NYC. There, I worked on methods to safeguard reinforcement learning and leverage deep learning for testing. 
In Summer 2018, I interned at Google, where I built large-scale static analysis to automatically generate <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html#fuzz-target">fuzz targets</a>. My team continued building on my work after my departure, resulting in the <a href="https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub48314">FUDGE</a> tool. In Summer 2017 I was a research intern in the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/tools-for-software-engineers/">Tools for Software Engineers</a> group at Microsoft, working on automating detection of anomolous errors in the distributed build system CloudBuild.
In May 2016 I received my B.Sc. (in 
Combined Honours Computer Science and Mathematics) at the University of British Columbia, and was awarded the Governor General's Silver Medal for highest standing in the graduating class of the Faculty of Science.

<td align="justify">
Parametric generators transform a bytestream input into a structured generator output. This trick allows us to get mutations "for free", enabling feedback-directed fuzzing over structured inputs. However, it leads to what we term the havoc effect: relatively small byte mutations can lead to relatively large structured input mutations. This paper compares plain parametric generators to three approaches to make generator mutations more sensible: Execution Indexing (JQF), BeDivFuzz, and linked crossover in Zeugma. These approaches all reduce the havoc effect, but there are only coverage increases in very particular cases (e.g., when input is not read strictly left-to-right).

A multitude of techniques have been suggested for Python type inference, from leveraging abstract interpretation to large language models. QuAC explores a simple but robust algorithm to Python type inference, by extracting the attributes that are referenced on each parameter, and using these to retrieve the most likely type. QuAC can recursively predict container types, and does so much more consistently than an LLM baseline. <a href="https://github.com/jifengwu2k/quac">QuAC's implementation</a> is available as open source, as well as a <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/13367665">replication package</a>.

Search-based test suite generation can get stuck when the test cases it generates are too far from "expected" uses of the code under test. Conveniently, Large Language Models of Code promise to produce "expected" code, when prompted properly. CodaMOSA explores the synergy between LLM-based test case generation and search-based mutation, achieving higher coverage than either search-based or LLM-based approaches on their own. 
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/codamosa">CodaMOSA's implementation</a> is available as open-source, but requires an OpenAI API key to query Codex.

<td align="justify">
Learning higher-level representations of a set of examples has applications to fuzzing, comprehension, and testing tasks, and is of interest at a fundamental language understanding level.  
Arvada takes in an example set and an oracle, and learns a grammar that expands that example set as much as possible. Arvada learns that grammar by trying to learn "parse trees" via a sequence of "bubble" and "merge" operations over the example set. The bubbles add structure, and the merges add generalization.

	Input-output examples as specifications for program synthesis are compelling as a simple communication language and for their flexibility. However, especially for table transformations, they can be tedious to fully provide, and also omit some easily-available user intent. Gauss combines a UI that creates a graph of user intent while a user builds a partial input-output example with a novel form of inductive reasoning over graphs. This allows for faster, more precise synthesis of table transformations, and opens the avenue of graphs as synthesis specification. You can try out Gauss's UI by launching the binder <a href="https://github.com/rbavishi/gauss-oopsla-2021">in the code base</a>!

<img src="rlcheck_logo.png" alt="RLCheck" width="250">

<td align="justify">
Effective property-based testing relies on the rapid generation of many diverse valid inputs for the program under test. However, when validity constraints on inputs are complex, this requires building specialized generators for each program under test. However, if an existing generator generates a superset of all valid inputs, we should be able to <i>guide</i> it to generate only valid inputs. <i>RLCheck</i> uses a Q-table based Reinforcement Learning approach to guide generators to produce many diverse valid inputs, given a validity function. RLCheck's Java implementation is <a href="https://github.com/sameerreddy13/rlcheck">available as open-source</a>.

Modern Python APIs are complex and very difficult to learn. Novice users could ask their API questions on StackOverflow, but the answer might be slow to arrive or unpersonalized... enter AutoPandas. AutoPandas is a programming-by-example synthesis engine for the Python API pandas, in particular for its dataframe transformations. To handle the complex space of API programs, AutoPandas uses a novel <a href="https://github.com/rbavishi/atlas">neural-backed generator</a> approach to synthesizing programs in the pandas API. You can try out AutoPandas live <a href="https://rbavishi.github.io/autopandas">here</a>.

 <a href="https://github.com/rohanpadhye/FuzzFactory">FuzzFactory</a> is an extension of AFL that generalizes coverage-guided fuzzing to domain-specific testing goals. FuzzFactory allows users to guide the fuzzer's search process without having to modify the core search algorithm. FuzzFactory's key abstraction is that of waypoints: intermediate inputs that are saved during the fuzzing loop. For example, PerfFuzz saves inputs that increase loop execution counts, a magic-byte fuzzer may save inputs that have partially correct magic bytes, or a directed fuzzer may save inputs that are more likely to exercise a program point of interest.

Binary-level mutational fuzzing excels at exercising the syntactic (parsing) phase of programs, but produces few valid inputs that exercise deeper stages of the program. <a href="https://github.com/pholser/junit-quickcheck">QuickCheck-style</a> random testing allows us to test programs with random generators of highly-structured inputs, but does not use program feedback to bias its input generation. <a href="https://github.com/rohanpadhye/jqf">Zest</a>, the default front-end of our <a href="https://github.com/rohanpadhye/jqf">JQF</a> platform, leverages (1) QuickCheck-style generators to generate only syntactically valid inputs, and (2) program coverage and validity feedback to generate inputs which explore deep parts of the program.

Performance problems in software can arise unexpectedly when programs are provided with inputs that exhibit pathological behavior. But how can we find these inputs in the first place? Given a program and at least one seed input, <a href="https://github.com/carolemieux/perffuzz">PerfFuzz</a> automatically generates inputs that exercise pathological behavior across program locations, without any domain knowledge.

 <a href= "https://github.com/carolemieux/afl-rb">FairFuzz</a> is a fuzzer built on top of 
 <a href=http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/>AFL</a> which targets rare branches to achieve faster program coverage. FairFuzz achieves this by (1) selectively mutating inputs which exercise branches hit by few fuzz-tester generated inputs and (2) using a <i>mutation mask</i> to restrict mutations of these inputs to the parts which can be mutated while still hitting the branch of interest. On our benchmarks, FairFuzz achieves program coverage than AFL or AFLFast, and has a particular advantage on programs with <i>highly nested structure</i>.

I am the main developer of the <a href= "https://bitbucket.org/bestchai/texada">Texada</a> tool,

Texada takes as input a log of traces and a property type expressed in LTL and outputs
instantiations of this property types with log events which hold on the entire log. Texada
also supports confidence and support thresholds to allow for mining on imperfect or
incomplete logs.
