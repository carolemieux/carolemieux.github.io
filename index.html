<h2>About</h2>
<div class="hbar">
</div> 
<section class="inner">
<p>I am a first year Ph.D. student at the University of California Berkeley, in <a href="http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ksen">Koushik Sen</a>'s group. In May 2016 I received my B.Sc. at the University of British Columbia, majoring in 
Combined Honours Computer Science and Mathematics, and was awarded the Governor General's Silver Medal (highest standing in the graduating class of the Faculty of Science).
</p>
<p>
My research interests centre around improving, or helping developers to improve, 
the correctness, reliability, and understanding of software systems. I am particularly
interested in developing automated methods for engineering tasks such as testing, debugging, and
comprehension, 
and lean towards work with empirical aspects. 
At UBC, I worked
with <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bestchai/">Ivan Beschastnikh</a> on specification mining 
tools. 
</p>
<p>
Additionally, I have always been passionate about helping my fellow students learn, and
was an undergraduate teaching assistant at UBC.

I am a main developer of the <a href= "https://bitbucket.org/bestchai/texada">Texada</a> tool,
which mines linear temporal logic (LTL) relationships of arbitrary length and complexity from textual logs.
Texada takes as input a log of traces and a property type expressed in LTL and outputs
instantiations of this property types with log events which hold on the entire log. Texada
also supports confidence and support thresholds to allow for mining on imperfect or
incomplete logs. You can now try <a href= "https://bestchai.bitbucket.org/texada">Texada</a>.

I am now building the Quarry tool. Quarry interfaces data invariants with temporal
invariants in order to extract data-temporal invariants of 
arbitrary length and complexity. Quarry 
mines relationships between Daikon-style data invariants specified
in linear temporal logic (LTL). Quarry uses Daikon for data invariant
inference and Texada for inference of temporal invariants.

I have worked on one of UBC's first computer science MOOCs, Introduction to Systematic Program
Design, while the course was still hosted on Coursera.
I worked on both MOOC offerings, focusing mostly on video lecture development, but also participating in TA
tasks like replying to students on forums and composing peer-graded projects. The video lectures from
the Coursera offering were used in CPSC 110, UBC's introductory computer science course, and are available
for viewing <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7dEjIUwSxSNcW4PqNRQW8w">here</a>. </td></tr>
