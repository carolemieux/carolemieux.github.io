<h1>Information for Prospective Students</h1>
 <p><b>News:</b> I plan to admit 1-2 graduate students for the 2024-2025 academic year. I will consider both Master's and PhD applicants. The Master's is a <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/grad/policies/grad-handbook/msc-program-toc/msc-program/12-credit-msc-thesis-thesis-masters">2-year research Master's</a>; I generally do not take on essay (course-based) Masters's students. If ultimately you want to do a PhD, but are not sure you want to commit to the full 5 years, the <a href="">PhD Track</a> is a good choice. </p>
 
<h2>Application Logistics</h2>
<p>General guidelines:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Visit the prospective applicant page on the <a href="https://www.grad.ubc.ca/prospective-students/graduate-degree-programs/phd-computer-science" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UBC website</a> and on <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/grad/prospective" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the CS website</a> for more information.
  </li>
  <li>Apply online following the instructions on the <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/grad/admissions/application-components-required-documents/online-application">CS Website</a>. The application deadline is typically mid-December, please check the CS website for updated information (2024-2025 Academic Year: December 15 2023)</li>
  <li>If you are interested in working with me, list me as a supervisor in the drop-down menu in the application form. </li>
  <li><i><b>I cannot process applications by email</b></i> or make guarantees about supervision before your official application is received.</li>
  <li>The department will start processing applications in January after the application deadline; admissions decisions will be made through April.</li>
  <li>I will reach out to applicants who seem like a good match for interviews in January/February.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Application Tips</h2>
<p>The UBC Thesis Master's program is <i>research-focused</i>. That means that while you will take some classes, the main focus is in writing a thesis, which could become an academic publication. The Master's is a good option for students who want to do research if they want to spend the next 5+ years doing research (as for a PhD). The Master's program, if advised by me, is not as good an option for students who are mostly looking to gain additional professional skills for a software engineering role.</p>
<p>The most important parts of your application are your Statement of Intent and Reference Letters.</p>
<p>You do not have control over the reference letters beyond choosing your reference writers. try to choose reference writers who know you personally, e.g. your undergraduate research supervisor. A professor whose class you took can be a good option if the professor knows you well (because it was a small class, or you went to office hours), and you did well in the class. </p>
<p>You <i>do</i> have control over your Statement of Intent (SoI), however. I am looking for 3 main things in a statement of intent:
<ul> 
  <li>
    Demonstrate you understand what research is. 
  </li> 
  <li>
    Describe of the research you have done.
  </li>
  <li>
    Describe of the research you would like to do in your graduate studies. Even better if you say why UBC is a good place for you, and why I am a good advisor for you, to pursue these studies. 
   <ul>
    <li>
    You will not be tied to doing this research for your graduate studies; the purpose is to convey to me what types of research problems interest you, and whether I might be a good advisor for you to work on those problems.
 </li>
  </ul>
  </li> 
</ul>
It is best to "show", not "tell": describing the research you have done, your understanding of its significance, and any extensions of that work that interest you, can demonstrate all these points well. 
</p>

<p>
  Additionally, your SoI is a place where you can briefly mention the existence of any hardships that might affect your application: e.g., if you had one semester where you failed your courses due to medical or family emergency. 
  </p>

<h2>Contacting me</h2>
<p>
You are welcome to contact me if you have additional clarification questions. However, as mentioned above, <i><b>I cannot process applications or make guarantees about supervision by email</b></i>.  
</p>
<p>
If you are contacting me via email, put "[prospective-student]" as the first part of your subject line. I get many emails from prospective students and cannot answer them all; this helps me spot emails with specific queries.</p>
You can also email me to let me know you have applied, if you are particularly interested in working with me---if so, briefly mention in your email why you are particularly interested in UBC and my research group. 
</p>


  <h2>Additional Information</h2>
<a href="https://tfjmp.org/">Thomas Pasquier's</a> information for potential students ("Joining my Lab") is very helpful in outlining a good Statement of Intent, and the importance of research fit with your supervisor. <a href="https://www.williamjbowman.com/blog/2020/02/08/one-inside-perspective-on-the-graduate-student-application-process/">William Bowman</a> explains one perspective on the application process in more detail.
